# Background

HotShot is a hybrid, committee electing, Proof of Stake protocol for the partially synchronous model that exhibits
optimistic responsiveness and linear communication footprint.

HotShot's construction borrows heavily from the construction of [Hotstuff](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069) and
[Algorand](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/gilad-algorand-eprint.pdf), in many senses being a synthesis of
Hotstuff's protocol with Algorand's sortition.

# Protocol Overview

HotShot comes in two variants, [Pipelined HotShot](#pipelined) and [Sequential HotShot](#sequential).
Sequential HotShot is the simpler of the two variants, and is the basal form, from which Pipelined HotShot is
derived, so it will be discussed first.

## Basics

The operation of HotShot is divided in to a sequence of discrete epoch, referred to as
'views'. Each view is assigned an integer index (represented as a [`u64`]) starting with 0, which is
monotonically increasing.

In each view number, a singe node is designated the 'leader'[^1], and is responsible for driving
consensus for that round. The leader changes with each view number, and every caught-up node
independently calculates who they think the leader is, without communication.

For the sake of simplicity, the leaders are not described as voting, however, the leader in a given
view additionally performs all the actions that a replica would, in addition to its own, including
voting.

All nodes maintain an internal reference to a Quorum Certificated called the LockedQC, which is
updated when the node commits a Leaf. Nodes will only accept leaves that extend from their LockedQC
_or_ leaves that extend from a QC with a view number higher than that of any QC the node has seen.

### View Timeouts

The particular method a node uses to determine if a round has timed out is not important for safety,
but is critical for liveness.

Currently, nodes apply an approach where the timeout normally takes on a set value, but engages in
exponential back-off when a round fails, ensuring that _eventually_ enough nodes will been in the
same view number to complete a round.

At present, when a round does successfully complete, the timeout is immediately dropped all the way
back down to the set timeout value.

As the protocol exhibits optimistic responsiveness[^2], there is little detriment to setting the
base value for timeouts higher than is strictly necessary.


## Sequential

<br /><br />

Sequential HotShot does not currently support committee election or dynamically updating the
membership list, instead using a predefined list of participant nodes with equal weights. Sequential
HotShot is essentially identical to [Basic HotStuff](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069.pdf).

Each view of Sequential HotShot is divided into 4 stages the specifics of which depend on if the
node is the leader or a replica. Upon either reviving a commit QC in a round, or the round timing
out, a node will calculate the next leader, and send a NewView message for the next view number to
it, tagged with the nodes current prepareQC.

### Sequential Leader

1. Prepare

   In this phase, the leader:
   * Waits to receive NewView messages from at least `2f + 1` nodes
   * Selects the highest view-numbered Quorum Certificate from among the NewView messages to build
     off of (HighQC),
   * Creates a new Leaf building off of the HighQC, containing the transactions in the leader's
     mempool, tagged with the HighQC as its justification QC
   * Broadcasts the new Leaf to the network as a proposal
2. Pre-Commit

   In this phase, the leader:
   * Waits to receive at least `2f + 1` Votes (partial signatures) on its proposal from the Prepare
     phase
   * Packages the votes into a Quorum Certificate marked as originating in the Prepare phase
   * Broadcasts the Quorum Certificate to the network
3. Commit

   In this phase, the leader:
   * Waits to receive at least `2f + 1` Votes on the Quorum Certificate from the previous phase
   * Packages the votes into a Quorum Certificate marked as originating in the Pre-Commit Phase
   * Broadcasts the Quorum Certificate to the network
4. Decide

   In this phase, the leader:
   * Waits to receive at least `2f + 1` Votes on the Quorum Certificate from the previous phase
   * Packages the votes into a Quorum Certificate marked as originating in the Commit Phase
   * Broadcasts the Quorum Certificate to the network

### Sequential Replica

1. Prepare

    In this phase, the replica:
    * Waits for a proposal from the leader for the current view
    * Verifies that the proposal contains a valid block
    * Verifies that the proposal extends from the proposal's justification QC
    * Verifies that the proposal satisfies the safe node predicate
    * Generates a vote (partial signature) for the proposal for the prepare phase
    * Sends the vote to the leader
2. Pre-Commit

    In this phase, the replica:
    * Waits for a Prepare QC from the leader
    * Generates a vote for the proposal for the pre-commit stage
    * Sends the vote to the leader

3. Commit

    In this phase, the replica:
  * Waits for a Pre-Commit QC from the leader
  * Generates a vote for the proposal for the commit stage
  * Sends the vote to the leader

4. Decide

    In this phase, the replica:
  * Waits for the Commit QC from the node
  * Executes the commands between the previously committed Leaf and the one in the proposal for this
    view

## Pipelined

<p align="center">
<img src="./img/chained_hotstuff.svg" />
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Figure 2: Pipelined HotShot. The four stages (Prepare,Pre-Commit, Commit and Decide) are run in parallel across consecutive proposals.</i></p>
<br /><br />

One of the limitations of the sequential version of HotShot is that 3 rounds of interactions are needed before
a leader can commit a block. In order to increase the throughput and latency one can do the following:
* Have replicas handle the different stages (_Prepare_, _Pre-Commit_, _Commit_, _Decide_) yielding an update of the blockchain
state in "parallel" for consecutive/chained proposals during each view.
* Let leaders delegate the responsibility to move their initial proposal (Prepare) to the next stages
to the subsequent leaders/groups of replicas.

So in practice during each view *n*, a leader will propose a new extension to the blockchain, while
the replicas will update their internal state based on proposals made during the view *n* but also views *n-1*, *n-2*, and *n-3*.
As shown in Figure 2, during *view n* the following happens:
1. The leader proposes an extension *cmd n* to the state. This extension is based on the node propose by the previous leader during view *n-1*
2. Each replica send their vote to the next view leader for the new proposal.
3. If it is possible, each replica will run the instructions of the *pre-commit* stage for the proposal made during view *n-1*.
4. If it is possible, each replica will run the instructions of the  *commit* stage for the proposal made during view *n-2*.
5. If it is possible, each replica will run the instructions of the *decide* stage for the proposal during view *n-3*.

With the pipelined protocol, in case there are no failures, a new block will be committed at the end
of each view, which in this case involves only one interaction between each replica and the leader instead of
3 for the sequential version.

## Cryptographic sortition

In order to make HotShot permissionless, we rely on
 the cryptographic sortition algorithm introduced in the [Algorand](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/gilad-algorand-eprint.pdf) paper
(see Section 5).

The goal of this algorithm is to dynamically select a committee of small size in order to produce the next view.
Members of this committee use a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) in order to prove they have been elected for participating in the view.
The probability of being elected is proportional to the stake of each member.

Note that in HotShot the leader is not chosen by cryptographic sortition like in Algorand but defined in a deterministic manner
    as in Hotstuff.
Thus, our implementation of cryptographic sortition slightly differs from the Algorand's one (in particular the VRF does not take the *role* as input).

## Definitions

### Quorum Certificate

A Quorum Certificate is a threshold signature of a [`Leaf`](hotshot_types::data::Leaf), composed of
signatures from at least `2f + 1` nodes.

In the case of sequential HotShot, or pipelined HotShot without committee election, `f` is
defined to be the maximum number of faulty nodes the network can tolerate.

In the case of pipelined HotShot with committee election, `f` is defined to be the maximum number
of faulty committee seats the network can tolerate.

### Safe Node Predicate

The safe node predicate can be defined using the following rust-like pseudo-code

```ignore
fn safe_node(
    hot_shot: HotShot,
    proposal_node: Leaf,
    proposal_justifcation: QuorumCertificate,
) -> bool {
    let safety_rule = proposal_node.extends_from(hot_shot.locked_qc);
    let liveness_rule = proposal_justifcation.view_number > hot_shot.locked_qc;
    safety_rule || liveness_rule
}
```

In essence, a node is safe if it either extends from the nodes current locked_qc, _or_ contains a
justification quorum certificate with a view number higher than that of the node's current
locked_qc.

[^1]: Though, it should be noted, that it technically valid for the election process to specify
    arbitrarily many leaders for a round, but at most one of them will be able to make progress

[^2]: The network will complete a view and move on to the next one as fast as network conditions,
    irrespective of the timeout value for the round
