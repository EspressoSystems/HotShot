//! Abstractions over the immutable instance-level state and the global state that blocks modify.
//!
//! This module provides the [`InstanceState`] and [`ValidatedState`] traits, which serve as
//! compatibilities over the current network state, which is modified by the transactions contained
//! within blocks.
