# HotShot Consensus Module

HotShot is a BFT consensus protocol based off of HotStuff, with the addition of proof-of-stake and
VRF committee elections.

## Disclaimer

**DISCLAIMER:** This software is provided "as is" and its security has not been externally audited. Use at your own risk.

# Usage

Please see the rustdoc for API documentation, and the examples directory for usage.

## Dependencies

### Unix-like

#### Nix (macos and linux)

```
nix develop
```

#### Brew (macos)

```
brew install cmake protobuf
```

#### Apt-get (linux)

```
apt-get install cmake protobuf
```

### Windows

#### Chocolatey

```
choco install cmake protoc
```

#### Scoop

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install protobuf cmake
```

## Building

Once dependencies have been installed, to build everything:

```sh
just build
```



# Static linking

HotShot supports static linking for its examples:

```sh
# Nix-shell is optional but recommended
nix develop .#staticShell

just build
```

# Testing

To test:

```sh
RUST_LOG=$ERROR_LOG_LEVEL RUST_LOG_FORMAT=$ERROR_LOG_FORMAT just test
```

- `RUST_LOG=$ERROR_LOG_LEVEL`: The basic levels of logging include `warn`, `error`, `info`.
- `RUST_LOG_FORMAT=$ERROR_LOG_FORMAT`: The types of logging include `full`, `json`, and `compact`.
- Internally, the inclusion of the `--nocapture` flag indicates whether or not to output logs.
- Internally, we run at `--test-threads=1` because the tests spawn up a lot of file handles, and unix based systems consistently run out of handles.

To stress test, run the ignored tests prefixed with `test_stress`:
```sh
RUST_LOG=$ERROR_LOG_LEVEL RUST_LOG_FORMAT=$ERROR_LOG_FORMAT just run_test test_stress
```

## Careful

To double-check for UB:

```bash
nix develop .#correctnessShell
just careful
```

## Testing on CI

To test as if running on CI, one must limit the number of cores and ram to match github runners (2 core, 7 gig ram). To limit the ram, spin up a virtual machine or container with 7 gigs ram. To limit the core count when running tests:

```
ASYNC_STD_THREAD_COUNT=1 RUST_LOG=$ERROR_LOG_LEVEL RUST_LOG_FORMAT=$ERROR_LOG_FORMAT just tokio test
```

# Tokio-console

To use tokio-console, drop into the console shell:

```
nix develop .#consoleShell
```

Then, run an example.

On a separate terminal, also drop into the console shell and start tokio-console:
```
nix develop .#consoleShell -c tokio-console
```

This second window should now display task usage.

# Open Telemetry + Jaeger Integration

To view distributed logs with just the centralized server and one client, first edit the `centralized_server/orchestrator` file to include have a threshold and num_nodes of 1.

Then open three separate terminals.

```bash
# Terminal 1
# Start the jaeger instance to view spans
docker run -d -p6831:6831/udp -p6832:6832/udp -p16686:16686 -p14268:14268 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest

# Terminal 2
# Start the CDN

# Terminal 3
# Start the client
```

# Resource Usage Statistics

To generate usage stats:
- build the test suite
- find the executable containing the test of interest
- run profiling tools

The executable `cargo` uses is shown in the output of `cargo test`.

For example, to profile `test_stress_dht_many_round`:

```bash
# bring profiling tooling like flamegraph and heaptrack into scope
nix develop .#perfShell

# show the executable we need run
# and build all test executables (required for subsequent steps)
cargo test --verbose --release --lib --bins --tests --benches --workspace -- --test-threads=1
# the output cargo test contains the tests path:
#       Running `/home/jrestivo/work/crosscross/target/release/deps/counter-880b1ff53ee21dea test_stress --test-threads=1 --ignored`
#       running 7 tests
#       test test_stress_dht_many_rounds ... ok
#       ...

# a more detailed alternative to flamegraph
# NOTE: only works on linux
heaptrack $(fd -I "counter*" -t x | rg release) --ignored -- test_stress_dht_many_round --nocapture
# palette provides memory statistics, omission will provide cpu cycle stats as colors
# NOTE: must be run as root on macos
flamegraph --palette=mem $(fd -I "counter*" -t x | rg release) --ignored -- test_stress_dht_one_round
# code coveragte statistics
cargo-llvm-cov llvm-cov --test=test_stress_dht_many_round --workspace --all-targets --release --html --output-path lcov.html
```

This will output:
- `heaptrack.counter-$HASH` which is viewable by heaptrack. This provides a plethora of useful statistics about memory and cpu cycles.
- `flamegraph.svg` which is a (moderately) less detailed version of heaptrack.
- `lcov.html` generates a summary of code coverage.

# Debugging

A debugging config file is provided for vscode and vscodium in [`.vscode/launch.json`](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/HotShot/blob/main/.cargo/config). This is intended to be used with [vadimcn/vscode-lldb](https://open-vsx.org/extension/vadimcn/vscode-lldb) but may work with other rust debuggers as well.

To bring `lldb` into scope with nix, run `nix develop .#debugShell`.

# Git Workflow

For espresso developers we have written up a description of our workflow [here](./WORKFLOW.md).

# Extra Editor Configuration

Choose an async runtime to use before launching a text editor. This may be done by setting the environment RUSTFLAGS. For example:

```
nvim # launch text editor of choice. We choose neovim in this example
unset RUSTFLAGS # Unset rustflags so we may continue to use the justfile. The justfile sets these particular config options
```

# Debugging

We support the [CodeLLDB Debugger](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb).

## Neovim

Install [`dap`](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) and [`rust-tools`](https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim). Install the CodeLLDB debugger listed above.
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/discussions/671#discussioncomment-4286738) to configure the adapter. To add our project-local configurations, run:

```
lua require('dap.ext.vscode').load_launchjs(nil, { ["codelldb"] = {"rust"} })
```

Finally, place a breakpoint and run `:DapContinue` to begin debugging.

NOTE: Do NOT configure dap at all with rust-tools. Do it manually.

[Example configuration](https://github.com/DieracDelta/vimconfig/blob/master/modules/lsp.nix#L280).

## Vscode

Install the extension and load the `launch.json` file. Then run the desired test target.
