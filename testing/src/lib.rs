//! Testing harness for the hotshot repository
//!
//! To build a test environment you can create a [`TestLauncher`] instance. This launcher can be configured to have a custom networking layer, initial state, etc.
//!
//! Calling `TestLauncher::launch()` will turn this launcher into a [`TestRunner`], which can be used to start and stop nodes, send transacstions, etc.
//!
//! Node that `TestLauncher::launch()` is only available if the given `NETWORK`, `STATE` and `STORAGE` are correct.
