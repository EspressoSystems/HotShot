        ### Complete the following items before submitting this issue: 
        * Label this issue appropriately. All issues must have a `sprint` label unless they are labeled `external`, `low-priority`, or `tech-debt`.  This form will automatically label issues with our current `sprint` label.  
        * Ensure this issue is added to the appropriate projects.  This form should add them to the "HotShot" and "Espresso Sequencer" projects by default. 
        * Ensure this issue is titled correctly.  
          * For MACRO tasks, title the issue [MACRO] - <MACRO_SHORT_NAME> - Macro Task Short Description
            * E.g. [MACRO] - VIEW_SYNC - Add NK20 View Sync algorithm 
          * For non-MACRO tasks, title the issue [<MACRO_SHORT_NAME>] - Task Short Description
            * E.g. [VIEW_SYNC] - Create new vote types for `PreCommit`, `Commit`, and `Finalize` view sync votes
        * Ensure MACRO tasks have all their sub-issues linked 
        * Ensure non-MACRO tasks have their associated MACRO task linked
        * Assign this issue to the appropriate person, if applicable

        ### Other considerations: 
        * All non-macro tasks must link to a MACRO task unless the task falls into one of the following categories.  Use these categories in lieu of a MACRO_TASK_SHORT_NAME. 
          * TECH_DEBT - Label for tech debt 
          * CI - Label for CI-related issues
          * REPO - Label for repository organization issues (such as updating these template files)
          * DOCS - Label for issues related to documentation
        * If a non-MACRO task has linked sub-issues, consider converting it into a MACRO task.  Non-macro tasks should be small enough in scope that they do not contain sub-issues.  They may contain sub-tasks, however.
