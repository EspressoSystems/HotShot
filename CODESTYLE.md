# HotShot Code Style Guide

## Logging Guidelines

### Debug
Use `debug!` for routine events that occur frequently within the system.

Example:
```rust
debug!("View {} decided", view_number);
```

### Info
Use `info!` for events that occur under specific conditions, which are not issues but might aid in debugging.

Example:
```rust
if missing_data {
    info!("Fetching missing data for query {}", query_id);
}
```

### Warn
Use `warn!` for events that indicate a potential issue, which the system can handle, but might require human attention.

Example:
```rust
if message_loss_rate > threshold {
    warn!("Increased message loss detected: {}", message_loss_rate);
}
```

### Error
Use `error!` for critical issues that could lead to a permanent degradation of the system without manual intervention.

Example, we log an error when safety and liveness are violated:
```rust
if !safety_check && !liveness_check {
    error!("Failed safety and liveness check \n High QC is {:?}  Proposal QC is {:?}  Locked view is {:?}", consensus.high_qc, proposal.data.clone(), consensus.locked_view);
}
```
