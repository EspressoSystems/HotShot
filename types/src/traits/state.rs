//! Abstraction over the global state that blocks modify

//! This module provides the [`State`] trait, which serves as an abstraction over the current
//! network state, which is modified by the transactions contained within blocks.

/// Abstraction over the state that blocks modify
///
/// This trait represents the behaviors that the 'global' ledger state must have:
///   * A defined error type ([`Error`](State::Error))
///   * The type of block that modifies this type of state ([`Block`](State::Block))
///   * A method to get a template (empty) next block from the current state
///     ([`next_block`](State::next_block))
///   * The ability to validate that a block is actually a valid extension of this state
///     ([`validate_block`](State::validate_block))
///   * The ability to produce a new state, with the modifications from the block applied
///     ([`append`](State::append))
///     TODO add hash function to trait
///     NOTE (see hash)
